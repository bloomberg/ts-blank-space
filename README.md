A small, fast, pure JavaScript, type-stripper using the official TypeScript parser.

[![npm Badge](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ts-blank-space.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-blank-space)

---

TypeScript goes in:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```typescript
class C<T> extends Array<T> implements I {
//     ^^^              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    private field!: string;
//  ^^^^^^^      ^^^^^^^^^

    method<T>(this: T, a?: string): void {
//        ^^^ ^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^
    }
}
```

JavaScript + space comes out:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
class C    extends Array                 {
//     ^^^              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            field         ;
//  ^^^^^^^      ^^^^^^^^^

    method   (         a         )       {
//        ^^^ ^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^
    }
}
```

## Rationale

The benefits of this library are:

-   It is fast
    -   See [`./perf`](./perf/) folder for a micro-benchmark
        -   Only 4 times slower than a native multi-threaded transformer
        -   Fastest compared to non-native (JavaScript or Wasm)
    -   No new JavaScript code is generated, instead it re-uses slices of the existing source string
    -   This is particularly true if your program is already generating the TypeScript `SourceFile` object because it can [be reused](#bring-your-own-ast), and producing the AST is the most time consuming part.
-   100% JavaScript runtime
    -   No [Wasm](https://webassembly.org)
    -   No [native-addons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html)
    -   No [child process](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html)
-   It is small
    -   Less than 700 lines of code and one dependency ([`typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript))
    -   By doing so little the code should be relatively easy to maintain
-   Delegates the parsing to the [official TypeScript parser](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API)
-   No need for additional SourceMap processing. See ["where are my SourceMaps?"](#where-are-my-sourcemaps)

:information_source: Not all TypeScript syntax is supported (see [unsupported syntax](#unsupported)). There is also no down leveling, the JavaScript is preserved as is.

## Installing

```sh
npm install ts-blank-space
```

## API

### String to String

```typescript
export default function tsBlankSpace(ts: string, onError?: (node) => void): string;
```

```javascript
import tsBlankSpace from "ts-blank-space";

console.log(tsBlankSpace(`let x: string;`));
// "let x        ;"
```

### Bring your own AST

```typescript
export function blankSourceFile(ts: typescript.SourceFile, onError?: (node) => void): string;
```

```javascript
import ts from "typescript";
import { blankSourceFile } from "ts-blank-space";

const ast = ts.createSourceFile(...);
console.log(blankSourceFile(ast));
```

## Node.js Loader

`ts-blank-space` exposes the required [Node.js module loader hooks](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#customization-hooks) to use `ts-blank-space` to pre-process `*.ts` that are imported before they are evaluated.

```sh
# Install (one time):
$ npm install --save-dev ts-blank-space

# Example usage (Node.js v18.18):
$ node --import ts-blank-space/register ./path/to/your/file.ts
```

In addition to loading `*.ts` files, an import resolver is also registered which catches failed `*.js` imports and re-attempts the import replacing the extension with `.ts`. This allows import paths to choose either `.ts` or `.js` depending on which other factors the project may need to take into account such as bundling and package distribution.

:information_source: The loader assumes that all `.ts` files are [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html).

## Where are my SourceMaps?

Because all the JavaScript in the output is located at the same line, column, and byte-offset as the original source
there is no mapping information that is lost during the transform.

## Does it really just blank out all the type annotations?

There are two cases, described here, where it does more than replace the TypeScript syntax with blank space.

### ASI (automatic semicolon insertion)

To guard against [ASI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#automatic_semicolon_insertion) issues in the output `ts-blank-space` will add `;` to the end of type-only statements.

Example input:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```typescript
statementWithNoSemiColon
type Erased = true
("not calling above statement")
```

becomes:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
statementWithNoSemiColon
;
("not calling above statement");
```

### Arrow function return types that introduce a new line

If the annotation marking the return type of an arrow function introduces a new line before the `=>`
then only replacing it with blank space would be incorrect.

So in addition to removing the type annotation, the `)` is moved down to the end of the type annotation.

Example input:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```typescript
let f = (a: string, b: string): Array<
   string
> => [a, b];
```

becomes:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
let f = (a        , b

) => [a, b];
```

## Unsupported

Some parts of TypeScript are not supported because they can't be erased in place due to having
runtime semantics. See [unsupported_syntax.md](./docs/unsupported_syntax.md).

When unsupported syntax is encountered `ts-blank-space` will call the optional `onError` callback and continue.
Examples can be seen in [`errors.test.js`](./tests/errors.test.js).

## Recommended `tsconfig.json` compiler settings

```jsonc
{
    // Because JS syntax is emitted as-is
    "target": "esnext",
    // Because class fields are preserved as written which corresponds
    // to 'define' semantics in the ECMAScript specification
    "useDefineAsClassFields": true,
    // Because imports and exports are preserved as written, only removing the
    // parts which are explicitly annotated with the `type` keyword
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
}
```

## TSX/JSX

`.tsx` input will be `.jsx` output because the JSX parts are not transformed, and instead preserved in the output.

By default `ts-blank-space` will parse the file assuming `.ts`. If the original file contains JSX syntax
then the [parsing should be done manually](#bring-your-own-ast). There is a TSX example in [`valid.test.js`](./tests/valid.test.js).

## Ensuring ESM output

TypeScript may add an `export {};` if all `import`s and `export`s were removed (because they were `import/export type`).

Because `ts-blank-space` only removes code this is not performed. To force the output to always have an ESM syntactic marker you can manually append `"export {};"`;
